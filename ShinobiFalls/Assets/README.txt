// STANDARDS TEXT:
// 
// This document is for maintaining a folder structure and standard practice for file management.
// Each member should familiarize themselves with the following guideline standards:
// 
// (1) Your personal "Assets" folder is "Assets/<YOURNAME>/... "
// 
// Each person on the team has their own folder, treat this folder like you would the "Assets" folder.
// 
// (2) Try keep to the <Preset> folder structure, as provided. If adding folders, please keep it clean, and intuitive.
// 
// (3) Whenever you complete a deliverable (functioning assets, scripts, prefabs, or resource etc), create a versioned 
// Unity Package and place it in the "PACKAGES" folder, located in "Assets/PACKAGES/..."
// 
// https://docs.unity3d.com/2018.1/Documentation/Manual/HOWTO-exportpackage.html
// 
// (4) When testing out Unity Store Assets, please test outside of the main project first, and re-package before 
// importing into the main project. This is to avoid problems.
// 
// (5) Fix all CONSOLE WARNINGS, and ERRORS as they occur. If you have a WARNING or ERROR that you can't fix, 
// ASK FOR HELP. Even though WARNINGS are still working, they usually mean there is a better method for handling it. 
// Ignoring them can lead to performance issues, which in no world, or context do people like. But it's all about best 
// practice, and staying up to date with current coding standards. For more information on the link below.

//  
// (6) When creating a new Scene, please Clone the SAMPLE scene in "Assets/..." as a starting point.
